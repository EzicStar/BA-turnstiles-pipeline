# Buenos Aires Subway Turnstiles Data Pipeline
## Overview

Buenos Aires subway, also known as "Subte", was the first underground metro system in Latin America and the Southern Hemisphere. The goal of this project is to apply Data Engineering concepts to extract, process and visualize data recorded by the turnstiles of the stations. 
The steps required for acomplishing this goal are the following:

 - Upload all source data into a Data Lake.
 - Format data and upload it into a Data Warehouse.
 - Make a model with high-level transformations.
 - Visualize data.
